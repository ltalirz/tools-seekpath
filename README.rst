In this repository we provide the code to deploy an online service for 
the visualization of the band paths and primitive cells of the crystal 
structures. A live demo is currently hosted on the `Materials Cloud`_ web portal.

This tool leverages `seekpath`_, a python module to obtain and visualize band
paths in the Brillouin zone of crystal structures. 
The definition of k-point labels follows crystallographic convention, as defined
and discussed in the `HPKOT paper`_. Moreover, the Bravais lattice is detected
properly using the spacegroup symmetry. Also the suggested band path provided
in the `HPKOT paper`_ is returned.
Systems without time-reversal and inversion-symmetry are also properly 
taken into account.

- You should also cite `spglib`_ that is an essential library used in the 
  implementation.
