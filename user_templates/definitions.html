  <p>This tool follows the definitions of the <a href="#hpkot">HPKOT paper</a>. The main advantages of this work are:
  <ul>
  <li><strong>use of the <em>crystallographic</em> cells</strong>: The conventional cell is standardized according to the definitions that are
  standard in the field in crystallography: the <em>International Tables of Crystallography</em> (the Tables, from here on), and <em>Parth&eacute;, Gelato, Acta Cryst. A40, 169 (1984)</em>. Just a couple of examples:
  <ul>
    <li>orientation of the axes follows the standards mentioned above, e.g., monoclinic cells are always <em>b</em>-axis unique.</li>
    <li>order of axes is imposed only when not already imposed by symmetry, (following the prescriptions of Parth&eacute; and Gelato). E.g., for spacegroup Pmm2 (orthorhombic), the third axis is fixed by symmetry (the one with 180&deg; rotation but no mirror plane). Therefore, we only impose <em>a&lt;b</em>, with no ordering imposed on <em>c</em>.</li>
   </ul></li>
  <li><strong>Unambiguous high-symmetry k-point labels</strong>. For rational k-points, we use the same labels as the ones defined in the Tables. For irrational k-points (not defined in the Tables), letters are chosen so as to never collide with existing letters in the Tables.</li>
  <li><strong>Complete set of high-symmetry paths (band lines), using also spacegroup symmetry when needed</strong>. For instance, spacegroup Pm-3 (cubic primitive, extended Bravais lattice cP1) does not have 90&deg; rotation symmetries, so both the lines M&ndash;X and M&ndash;X<sub>1</sub> must be considered.</li>
  </ul>
